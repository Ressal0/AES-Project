# AES Encryption/Decryption GUI Application

## Description
This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) application for AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption. It is built using Python's Tkinter library and includes custom AES encryption and decryption functions. Users can input plaintext, generate an AES key, encrypt the text, and decrypt ciphertext back to plaintext.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext using a provided or randomly generated AES key.
- **AES Decryption**: Decrypt ciphertext using the provided AES key.
- **Key Generation**: Generate a random 16-byte AES key.
- **GUI**: User-friendly interface for performing encryption and decryption operations.

## Installation
To run this application, you need Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aes-encryption-gui.git
cd aes-encryption-gui
```
2. Run the application:
```bash
python gui.py
```
3. Use the interface to input plaintext, generate an AES key, and encrypt the text. You can also decrypt ciphertext using the provided key.

## Files
- `custom_aes.py`: Contains the AES encryption and decryption logic.
- `gui.py`: Contains the code for the graphical user interface.

## Dependencies
- `tkinter`: Used for the graphical user interface.
- `os`: Used for key generation.


## Acknowledgements
This project was developed as part of a school assignment on encryption and decryption techniques using Python.
